Return true if the human player wins, and false if the computer player wins.

Has a single parameter. This parameter will be a string value representing the winner.
Increases the score variable (humanScore or computerScore) by 1 depending on the winner passed in to updateScore. The string passed in will be either 'human' or 'computer'.
Does not need to return any value.

/* Create an advanceRound() function. This function will be used to update the round number after each round.

advanceRound() should increase the value of currentRoundNumber by 1.

After completing advanceRound(), your Number Guesser game should be fully operational. You should be able to make guesses, see your or the computer score increase correctly, move to the next round, and see the correct round displayed.*/
